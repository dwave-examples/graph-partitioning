# Graph Partitioning

In this demo, we explore the graph partitioning problem.  This is an
interesting problem from graph theory with a wide variety of applications (see
e.g. [[3]](#3)).

For example, suppose that we have a group of people that we need to split into
two equal-sized teams.  Between some pairs of people there is a friendly
relationship.  We want to have as few friends on opposite teams as possible.
How can we solve this problem?

One way to solve this problem is with the graph partitioning problem.  If we
think of our group of people as a graph (a node/vertex for each person), and
draw an edge between people that are friends, we have a model of our network.
If we look for a minimum cut [[4]](#4) in our graph, then we are looking for a way
to split the nodes into two groups so that there are as few edges as possible
between the groups.  In our group of people, this means that we have two teams
with as few friends as possible on different teams.

We will run the demo to find the best way of splitting a 40-node graph (an
Erdos-Renyi random graph that probabilistically creates an edge between 20% of
its node pairs) into two subsets to minimize the number of cut edges.

## Usage

To run the demo, type:

```bash
python graph_partitioning.py
```

After running, output will be printed to the command line that states whether
or not the best (lowest energy) solution found is a valid partition that splits
the graph into two sets of 20 nodes.  If the solution is valid (feasible), then
the number of cut edges for that solution is displayed.

## Code Overview

The code implements a QUBO formulation of this problem.

The answer that we are looking for is a partition of the nodes in the graph, so
we will assign a binary variable for each node, i.e. variable `x_i` denotes
whether node `i` is in one subset (call it Subset 0) or the other (Subset 1).

The objective function that we want should minimize the number of cut edges. To
count how many cut edges we have given a partition of the nodes (assignment of
our binary variables), we start with a single edge.  The table below shows how
we count the cut edges for a given graph partition (assignment of values to our
binary variables). Columns `x_i` and `x_j` are two nodes; column edge (i, j)
represents an edge between these two nodes.  We only want to count an edge if
the endpoints are in different subsets, and so we assign a 1 for the edge column
in this case and a 0 otherwise.

| x_i | x_j | edge (i,j) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

From this table, we see that we can use the expression `x_i+x_j-2x_ix_j`
to calculate the edge column in our table.  Now for our entire graph, our
objective function can be written as shown below, where the sum is over all
edges in the graph, denoted by E.

Next we need to consider our constraint:  Subset 0 and Subset 1 must have the
same sizes.  We can measure the size of Subset 1 by summing up our binary
variables.  To ensure the two subsets have the same size, we enforce a
constraint that Subset 1 has size equal to half of all nodes in the graph.  We
first consider how to represent this constraint mathematically using our chosen
binary variables, and use the following equality to represent our constraint,
where V represents the set of all nodes in the graph.

![Constraint 1](readme_imgs/constraint_1.png)

For a QUBO, we need our constraints to be represented by mathematical
expressions that are satisfied at their minimum value.  For this constraint, we
can use the following expression that has a minimum value of 0 that occurs when
Subset 1 has size exactly `|V|/2`.

![Constraint 2](readme_imgs/constraint_2.png)

To simplify this expression and determine the coefficients for our QUBO
equation, we first multiply out the expression.

![Constraint 3](readme_imgs/constraint_3.png)

Next we can simplify this expression down to linear and quadratic terms for our
QUBO.  Recall that for binary variables we can replace any squared term with a
linear term (since 0^2=0 and 1^2=1), and we can remove any constant terms in
our QUBO.  This results in the following final expression for our constraint.

![Constraint 4](readme_imgs/constraint_4.png)

To combine our objective and constraints into a single QUBO expression, we
simply add together the objective function and our constraint (multiplied by
gamma, the Lagrange parameter).

![Final QUBO](readme_imgs/final_QUBO.png)

In the code, we create the Q matrix for this QUBO as a dictionary iteratively,
looping over the edges and nodes in our graph just as we see in the summation
of our QUBO expression.

This demo generates an Erdos-Renyi random graph using the `networkx` package
for our problem instance [[1]](#1). For more information on this graph
generator, see the [NetworkX documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.gnp_random_graph.html#networkx.generators.random_graphs.gnp_random_graph). 
There are three parameters to be set by the user in this code:  chain strength,
number of reads, and gamma.  Since this is a relatively large problem, we set a
large number of reads (`num_reads = 1000`).

For chain strength, we examine the entries in our Q matrix and choose a
relatively large number to enforce chains in our embedding.  For this problem,
our largest matrix entries are the linear coefficients (approximately size
`gamma*(1-1*len(G.nodes))`) and so a value of `gamma*len(G.nodes)` is
chosen on line 51 for `chain_strength`.

For gamma, our Lagrange parameter, a good number to start with is an estimate
for your optimal objective function value.  Since we are utilizing Erdos-Renyi
random graphs, we assume that our graph will have about 20% of the number of
cut edges that a complete graph would have (since our edge probability in G is
also 20%).  Since a complete graph on 40 nodes has 780 edges, and any partition
into equal subsets results in a cut of size 400 (20 nodes in each subset with
all 20x20 edges between subsets cut), we can estimate our objective function
value.  We are examining an Erdos-Renyi random graph with an edge probability
of 20%, we can estimate a cut of size approximately 20% of 400, or 80 edges.
This leads us to try a Lagrange parameter of 80, which is implemented in our
program with `gamma=80`.
